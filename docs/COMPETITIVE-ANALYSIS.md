### 6. Other Competitors

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | RSA Advantage |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **DragStat** | Deep run analysis, STP splits | Dated UI, Windows-only | Modern UX, cloud |
| **RaceWORKS** | Full-featured logbook | Complex, legacy | Simplicity |
| **DragTuner** | Mobile + cloud + weather | Heuristic prediction | Physics + ML |

## Cross-Competitor Patterns (Proven in Market)

### What Works:
1. **Weather + prediction is core value** - DA handling is non-negotiable
2. **Racers pay for wins, not charts** - "Turn on more win lights"
3. **Hybrid hardware + software** - But hardware-agnostic is a gap
4. **Old UX is tolerated, not loved** - Room for modern interface
5. **Training + support sells** - Education is a key value driver
6. **Cloud + multi-device under-served** - Mobile demand exists

### Marketing Messages That Work:
- "Turn on more win lights"
- "Seat time without fuel"
- "Fewer mistakes at the finish line"
- "Be deadly consistent"

## Feature Design Principles

When designing any RSA feature, ask:

1. **Does this help win more rounds?** (Not just "is it cool?")
2. **Is it simpler than CrewChief?** (Lower learning curve)
3. **Is it more powerful than GoDeadOn?** (Deeper analysis)
4. **Is it more transparent than Computech?** (Explain the "why")
5. **Does it work on mobile?** (Track-side usability)
6. **Does it strengthen our data model?** (Future ML/parity)

## Competitive Response Playbook

### If a competitor adds feature X:
1. Evaluate: Does it actually help racers win?
2. If yes: Add it, but make it simpler and more transparent
3. If no: Ignore it, stay focused on core value

### If a competitor attacks our positioning:
1. Double down on: Modern UX, transparency, ML-powered insights
2. Avoid: Feature bloat, complexity, hardware lock-in

### If a new entrant appears:
1. Assess: Are they mobile-first? Cloud-first? ML-powered?
2. If yes: Accelerate our roadmap in that area
3. If no: Continue current strategy
