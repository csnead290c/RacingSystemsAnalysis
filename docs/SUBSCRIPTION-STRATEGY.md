## Technical Implementation

### Feature Flags
Each feature should have a flag that checks:
```typescript
interface FeatureAccess {
  feature: string;
  requiredTier: 'free' | 'racer' | 'pro' | 'team' | 'enterprise';
  isAddOn: boolean;
  addOnId?: string;
}

function hasAccess(user: User, feature: string): boolean {
  const access = FEATURE_ACCESS[feature];
  
  // Check tier
  if (tierLevel(user.tier) >= tierLevel(access.requiredTier)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check add-ons
  if (access.isAddOn && user.addOns.includes(access.addOnId)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- User subscriptions
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  tier VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- active, cancelled, past_due
  billing_cycle VARCHAR(10), -- monthly, annual
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP,
  cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Add-ons
CREATE TABLE user_addons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  addon_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  cancelled_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Usage tracking (for limits)
CREATE TABLE usage (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  feature VARCHAR(50),
  count INTEGER,
  period_start DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, feature, period_start)
);
```

## Revenue Projections

### Assumptions
- 10,000 users in Year 1
- Conversion rates: FREE→RACER 10%, RACER→PRO 20%, PRO→TEAM 5%
