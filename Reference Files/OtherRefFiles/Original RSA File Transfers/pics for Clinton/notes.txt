note: some of these pictures are my printer scans of pictures photographers took at the racetrack that I purchased.  The actual pictures have the best quality and could be rescanned with another scanner if needed.

1. the white SC altered came first in 1989.  Won a $5k bracket race with it in 1990.

2. the black dragster replaced the altered in 1991.  Initial testing was with SC engine from white altered at Phoenix warmup race, but then transitioned to BED for a couple of races in early 1991.

3. Comp was tough back then with Bill Maropolus always right there . . . so 1st Comp partnership broke up and black dragster went back to SC and then 7.90 Index racing (won Div 7 race in Vegas).

4. black dragster was also initially used for FED with 4 cylinder Ford for a couple of races.

5. blue Neil & Parks dragster purpose built for FED racing was added to the stable.

6. blue Frameworks altered followed for JAA with 250 cid 4 cylinder Ford.  Sold that car to Dean Carter in 1999.

7. currently race with Dean Carter in AND and BND in Comp.  #10 in the world in 2021.
